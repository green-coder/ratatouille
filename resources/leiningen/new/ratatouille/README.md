## Usage

{% if tag.clojure %}### Clojure

To run the Clojure project:

```shell
lein run
```

To launch the Clojure program and connect to it via a REPL:

```shell
lein repl
```

{% endif %}{% if tag.clojurescript %}### Clojurescript

We use Figwheel Main for running Clojurescript during development.
More information can be found at https://figwheel.org/

To run the Clojurescript project:

```shell
lein fig:dev
```

A webpage to your app will open in a browser, and your clojurescript
program will be reloaded each time you modify its source code.
